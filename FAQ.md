# Why some collections have less than 1000 files?

Some galleries may have been removed or replaced by newest versions in the source site so I also remove them from my release.

Example: Anchira id 9703 (Night Play Roly-Poly) was replaced with Anchira id 12538. Because of this, the 9001-10000 batch has one less file.
