# Why some collections have less than 1000 files?

Some galleries may have been removed or replaced by newest versions in the source site so I also remove them from my release.

Example: Anchira id 9703 (Night Play Roly-Poly) was replaced with Anchira id 12538. Because of this, the 9001-10000 batch has one less file.

# What does "ongoing, X% complete" mean in release titles?

Releases are split by their numeric id numbers. The most recent releases will always be partial releases updated every 2 weeks on fridays.

Most of the releases will contain galleries withing a range of 1000 ids.

For example, if the most recent id of the download source is `12665`, the current ongoing release will be `example.com_12001-13000`, and the completion percentage will be 66% (12**66**5).

# What does \[v1\], \[v2\] mean in release titles?

Sometimes the source site or even I add or remove galleries from a collection. Removals often happen because a gallery has been replaced with a newer version. Removals and additions may also occur when a gallery is placed in the wrong collection.

# Nayumi/ndbiaw/HenTalk is a scammer! Why are you advertising his Discord server?

Yea, I know, I know. I'm too lazy to set my own server and deal with user management, bots, annoying user, etc. so I'm borrowing his server but I have absolutely no commitment to it.
